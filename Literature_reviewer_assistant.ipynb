Forthis purpose, we use a measure of redundancy in the identiﬁcation of the poor between the two\\npoverty measures (R\\n0). In Chile, over the past 25 years, R0has declined at a rate of 1.5% per year.\\nThe decline is unimportant during the 1990s, a decade of rapid economic growth, while it is notablethereafter, in a period characterized by modest economic growth and the progressive introduction anddeepening of social policies. The conditional correlation between socio-economic and demographic\\ncharacteristics with R\\n0is examined at the province and household levels. After controlling for the\\nhousehold non-eligibility across some of the indicators of the multidimensional poverty index, weﬁnd that the divergence in the identiﬁcation of the poor seems to be a real process which is not ran-\\ndomly distributed across the population. It is correlated with education improvements, increasing\\nurbanization, and reduction in household size. On the basis of our results, we argue that this diver-gence may be a more general phenomenon that tends to occur in countries undergoing demographic\\ntransition, urbanization, and progress in education. If so, and given the fact that poverty alleviation\\nstrategies are adopted partly on the basis of poverty statistics, the diverging identiﬁcation of the poormight have distributive consequences for the poor.\\n/C2112020 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\\nThe measurement of wellbeing and poverty have traditionally\\nand prominently taken place in the utilitarian space.1In this space,\\npoverty is deﬁned as an insufﬁcient level of consumption. Here, two\\ntypes of poverty measurements have become widely available. On\\nthe one hand, the direct measurement of consumption levels, which\\nis appealing as it is closely related to welfare or utility. It also has the\\nadvantage of being robust when changes in resources are transitory(see Hurd & Rohwedder, 2006; Mayer, 1993; Meyer & Sullivan, 2003 ;\\nandSlesnick, 1993, 2001 ).2On the other hand, the lack of consump-\\ntion data in many countries opened the space to income-based pov-\\nerty measures, in which poverty is deﬁned as the inability to dispose\\nthe income (resources) needed to reach a minimum level of\\nconsumption ( Slesnick, 2001 ).3\\nAlthough the utilitarian view played and plays a key role in pov-\\nerty measurement, it is subject to criticism. For instance, there is\\nno convincing explanation of why all individuals need to have\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.104944\\n0305-750X/ /C2112020 Elsevier Ltd.

Klasen), cvillalobos@utalca.cl\\n(C. Villalobos).\\n1Measures in the utilitarian space are a combination of welfarism, the principle of\\nsum-ranking, and act consequentialism ( Sen, 1979a ). See Sen (2009) for an updated\\nnormative discussion on the space where poverty should be measured. See Baujard\\n(2016) for a review of different utilitarian approaches to ethics and their inﬂuence in\\nwelfare economics.2Hurd and Rohwedder (2006) ﬁnd that households use wealth to smooth/sustain\\nconsumption when income decreases. Consequently, an income-based measure ofwellbeing could yield misleading results for many households, especially those whichconsist only of elderly members. One of the main disadvantages of consumption-based measures is that they require substantial amounts of resources and surveytime.\\n3There is evidence that different welfare distributions within the utilitarian space\\ncan produce signiﬁcantly different patterns in the identiﬁcation of the poor. Forinstance, in cross-sectional perspective, Meyer and Sullivan (2012) ﬁnd a signiﬁcant\\nmismatch in the identiﬁcation of the poor for the US when using two income-basedpoverty measures (the ofﬁcial poverty measure and the supplementary povertymeasure).

Moreover, fundamentally, what do we\\nunderstand under ‘utility’ and what is the proper function of social\\nwelfare to use when assessing the social outcome (i.e. the average\\nutility principle or the total utility principle; see Sen & Williams,\\n1982 ).4This question has also been posed by Sen (1993) , under\\nthe capability framework, where he argues that: ‘two persons with\\nidentical commodity holdings may have very unequal freedoms to\\nlead the lives they value’.5Sen (1970) , discussing the impossibility\\ntheorem put forward by Arrow (1951) , also argues that it is impos-\\nsible to give intrinsic value to utility, and, at the same time, to\\nendorse certain liberal values. Nozick (1974) believes that humans\\nare in fact hardly utilitarian as the mental state of happiness is not\\neverything that is valued by people.6Moreover, considerations of\\nagency, sympathy, and commitment imply that choices cannot be\\nrestricted exclusively to the value of commodity holdings ( Ruggeri\\nLaderchi, 1997 ).7\\nAlthough there is a wide recognition that poverty is a multidi-\\nmensional phenomenon, unidimensional utilitarian measures\\ncan, in principle, account for the multidimensionality of poverty.\\nIn fact, income poverty represents a multidimensional concept in\\nwhich the many dimension weights are based on relevant goods\\nexpenditures at the level of subsistence ( Ravallion, 2011 ).\\nThe mainstream income-poverty tradition turns out to be prob-\\nlematic, however, as resources are not a perfect proxy for inher-\\nently valuable states and activities ( Sen, 1985, 1992, 1999 ).\\nMarkets often do not exist, or else they function imperfectly\\n(Bourguignon & Chakravarty, 2003; Thorbecke, 2013 ). Additionally,\\nthere is the possibility that income is not broadly used in achieving\\na good quality of life ( Atkinson, 1989; Townsend, 1979; Sen, 1983,\\n1984; Thorbecke, 2013; Hausman, 2011 ) or in expanding key capa-\\nbilities ( Ruggeri Laderchi, Saith, & Stewart, 2003; Sen, 1980 ). Con-\\nsequently, the relationship between income and the ability to use\\nit is crucial in developing countries, in which, at least for a portion\\nof the population, having enough income does not guarantee the\\nability to purchase baskets of goods that are consistent with\\nachieving a good quality of life (see Streeten, 1981 ).8\\nGiven the aforementioned shortcomings of this approach, some\\nalternative theoretical frameworks were developed emphasizing\\nthe plurality of values when assessing wellbeing ( Baujard,\\n2016 ).9One of the most prominent alternative views is the capabil-ity approach, advocated by Sen (1985, 1992, 1999) , which is based\\non the concepts of process freedom and opportunity freedom. This\\napproach rejects the commodity space as the space in which free-\\ndom has to be judged ( Sen, 1993 ).10Sen (1989) argues that the prob-\\nlem of assessing the quality of life consists in deciding which doings\\nand beings (functionings) are valuable and also in evaluating the\\ncapability to function. Then, capability takes the form of a set of fea-\\nsible n-tuples of functionings ( Sen, 1985, 1992 ), and judgements\\nabout capability orderings take place in the multidimensional func-\\ntioning space. In this context, poverty is ultimately a matter of capa-\\nbility deprivation ( Drèze & Sen, 1999 ).11\\nUnlike the unidimensional approach to poverty measurement,\\nmultidimensional measures use joint deprivations across dimen-\\nsions to determine the poverty status of the units. They do this\\nby comparing deprivations across dimensions and seeking torespect the unit of measurement of each indicator. Venn diagrams,\\nthe dominance approach, statistical approaches, fuzzy sets, and the\\naxiomatic approach are methods for measuring multidimensional\\npoverty which are compatible with theoretical frameworks that\\nconsider a plurality of values when assessing wellbeing (see\\nAlkire et al., 2015 , for a detailed review of these multidimensional\\nmethods).\\nThe most inﬂuential of the alternatives to the methods that\\nadopt a social welfare function approach, focus on the counting\\nof deprivations in the multiple dimensions of welfare. They have\\nbeen particularly relevant to poverty alleviation policies and\\nhave been implemented in several contexts. Worth mentioning\\nare UNICEF’s Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis for Chil-\\ndren (MODA), based on child rights, and the Multidimensional\\nPoverty Index (MPI).\\n12Both methods build upon the capability\\napproach and are estimated using the Alkire-Foster method\\n(Alkire & Foster, 2011; De Neubourg, Chai, de Milliano, Plavgo, &\\nWei, 2012 ).\\nIf different frameworks for poverty measurement (namely, the\\nutilitarian and capability approaches and their associated mea-\\nsurement technologies) produce similar identiﬁcation outcomes,\\nthen there would be no interest related to the empirical question\\non how to identify the poor. During the 1990s, researchers tended\\nto overlook this issue, as inﬂuential literature claimed the exis-\\ntence of a close correlation between income achievements and\\nnon-income achievements ( Anand & Ravallion, 1993; Pritchett &\\nSummers, 1996; Anand & Bärninghausen, 2004 ). Such evidence\\nmotivated Devarajan, Miller, and Swanson (2002) to conclude that\\nrising incomes would be enough to achieve the non-income Mil-\\nlennium Development Goals. The lack of an even closer correlation\\nbetween income and non-income achievements drew attention to\\nthe provision of public services, income poverty and income\\ninequality ( Anand & Ravallion, 1993; Lipton & Ravallion, 1995;\\nMcGillivray, 2005 ).\\nContrarily, and more recently, several studies have found that\\nincome poverty is in fact not strongly correlated with achieved\\nfunctionings in key wellbeing indicators. For instance, Klasen\\n(2000) found that, for the worst-off sections of society, there\\nwas only a weak correlation between expenditure poverty and\\na composite non-monetary deprivation index in South Africa.\\nWhelan, Layte, and Maître (2004) showed that the level of pov-\\nerty identiﬁcation mismatch in Europe existed in both the cross-4Moreover, the diversity of views regarding the concept of utility is important. One\\ncan favour the traditional view of utility (the ‘hare’s view’), with its emphasis ondesires and their fulﬁlment, or the related choice-based understanding of utility byHarsanyi, or the interpretation by Mirrlees, who stated that utility directly describeswellbeing rather than a conception of it ( Sen and Williams, 1982, p. 64). On the other\\nhand, there is the Benthamite utility conception, which relies on the concepts of\\npleasure and pain and is less acceptable now.\\n5In words of Sen (1993) : ‘A disabled person with the same commodity bundle may\\nbe just as rich as another, but still lack the capability to move about freely and toachieve other functionings that are affected by that disability.’\\n6Sen (1979b, 1980) claims that utilitarianism neglects any other values by\\nreducing (social) wellbeing only to individual utility information (welfarism)representing a totally inadequate framework for analysing issues of distribution.\\n7Other critiques of utilitarianism were made by Yaari and Bar-Hillel (1984)\\nshowing that the assessment of income distributions is based on needs rather thantastes or beliefs, and more recently, Hausman (2011) claims that individuals may\\nbehave against their own interest, which is a contradiction under the utilitarianframework. In a review of the historical deployment of the utilitarian ideas, Baujard\\n(2016) considers all versions of utilitarianism as fundamentally welfarist.\\n8For instance, the crowding out effect of non-basic-needs purchases on food,\\nshelter, clothing, health, sanitation, clean water, education, transport, and culturalfacilities.\\n9For instance, approaches based on the importance of primary goods ( Rawls,\\n1971 ), basic needs ( Hicks & Streeten, 1979 ;Streeten, Burki, Haq, Hicks, & Stewart,\\n1981 ;Stewart, 1985 ), social inclusion ( Atkinson & Marlier, 2010 ), social protection\\n(Barrientos, 2013 ), complex equality ( Walzer, 1983 ), Ubuntu ( Metz & Gaie, 2010 ),\\nhuman rights ( CONEVAL, 2010 ), livelihoods ( Bowley & Burnett-Hurst, 1915 ), Buen\\nVivir ( Hidalgo-Capitán, Guillén, & Deleg, 2014 ), and the Catholic social teaching\\n(Curran, 2002 ).10Following Drèze and Sen (2013, 43) , the capability approach sees human\\nprogress, ultimately, as ‘the progress of human freedom and capability to lead thekind of lives that people have reason to value’.\\n11The capability approach does not impose restrictions on the nature of utility\\nfunctions and the functional form for their aggregation. It allows the existence of\\npublic goods and externalities and does not have any preconception about the\\ntransformation of resources into wellbeing.\\n12Since 2013, the MPI is the unique non-utilitarian poverty measure employed in\\nChile.2 S.

In a developed country setting, Suppa (2016) com-\\npares Germany’s ofﬁcial income-based poverty measurement\\nwith a multidimensional poverty index and ﬁnds a signiﬁcant\\npoverty identiﬁcation mismatch which is robust when stricter\\npoverty lines are used.

Addressing\\nthis issue, this paper makes three main contributions to the lit-\\nerature in this ﬁeld. Firstly, it provides a 25-year analysis of the\\nassociation between two mainstream poverty measures repre-\\nsenting complementary views on poverty (the utilitarian and\\nthe capability views). The utilitarian approach bases its identiﬁ-\\ncation of the poor on the standard and ofﬁcially recognized mon-\\netary poverty measure. The capability framework is usually\\napplied using the Alkire-Foster method, and in this case, based\\non this method, we calculated a Historical Multidimensional\\nPoverty Index (HMPI), to cover the 25 years between 1992 and\\n2017 in Chile. The Alkire-Foster MPI was selected to assess the\\npoverty overlap due to its widespread use worldwide, as well\\nas its advantages over other multidimensional poverty mea-\\nsures.13To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the\\nlongest trend comparison of the identiﬁcation outcomes reached\\nby such alternative and relevant approaches. Our second contribu-\\ntion is to exploit this time variability to provide evidence about\\nthe nature of the identiﬁcation mismatch between income poverty\\nand multidimensional poverty, as well as its determinants, explor-\\ning the role of household composition and characteristics at differ-\\nent aggregation levels using panel data. Thirdly, following Dotter\\nand Klasen (2014) , the non-eligibility of certain parts of the pop-\\nulation in a subset of indicators of the MPI can be an important\\nempirical issue. To address this issue, we provide 25 years of\\nnovel evidence on the impact of the non-eligible populations on\\nthe identiﬁcation discrepancy between the multidimensional and\\nincome-poverty measures.\\nThe paper is organized as follows. The next section is devoted\\nto presenting the data and analytical strategies for drawing up\\nan HMPI for Chile for the period 1992–2017, and the poverty\\noverlap measures. For the same period, Section 3 describes the\\ntrends in poverty, economic growth, social policy, poverty over-\\nlaps, and the shares of HMPI non-eligible populations. Section 4\\noutlines the results of our conditional analyses at the province\\nand household levels. Finally, conclusions are presented in\\nSection 5 .2. Data, analytical strategies for the income poverty, Historical\\nMultidimensional Poverty Index (HMPI), and the poverty\\noverlap measures\\n2.1. The data\\nThis study employs data from all twelve waves of the Chilean\\nhousehold survey (‘Encuesta Nacional de Caracterización Socio\\nEconómica’ – CASEN) for the years 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000,\\n2003, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017. The twelve complex\\nhousehold surveys are representative at the country, regional andurban/rural levels of aggregation, covering the full population of\\nthe country, which was 13.5 million inhabitants in 1992 and 17.8\\nmillion inhabitants in 2017. All estimations in this study provide\\nunbiased analytical standard errors that account for the complex\\nsurvey design of CASEN household surveys.\\n2.2. Methodology to identify the monetarily poor\\nTo determine severe income poverty and income poverty,\\nCASEN household surveys reliy on a food poverty line and on apoverty line, respectively. Although the identiﬁcation methodology\\nunderwent some changes in 1996 and 2013, for the empirical pur-\\nposes of comparing the identiﬁcation of the poor using the two\\napproaches (income and multidimensional), we consider the ofﬁ-\\ncial identiﬁcation of the income-poor as given and as ofﬁcially\\nreported by the CASEN household surveys.\\n14\\n2.3. Methodology to identify the multidimensionally poor\\nFollowing the Alkire-Foster method, a population of interest of\\nnindividuals i¼1;/C1/C1/C1;n fg ðÞ is measured across dachievement\\nindicators ðj¼1;/C1/C1/C1;d fg Þ . Each indicator jhas a corresponding\\ndeprivation cutoff zj. An individual is deprived in indicator jif\\nhis/her achievement in that indicator is below zj(that is, xij<zj).\\nwjis the weight of indicator jand the sum of the dindicators equal\\nto one. The deprivation matrix g0¼½g0\\nij/C138deﬁnes each entry as equal\\ntowjifxij<zjand 0 otherwise. The method does not impose the\\nrestriction of equal weights across dimensions. Here, higher\\nweights imply a greater relative value of dimensional deprivation.\\nA deprivation score vector can be calculated for each person as\\nci¼Pd\\nj¼1g0\\nij. This vector contains the sum of his/her weighted\\ndeprivations. The identiﬁcation of the poor relies on a poverty cut-\\noff denoted by kand on an identiﬁcation function qk. Then a mul-\\ntidimensionally poor individual has a deprivation score which is\\nhigher than k:That is, qk¼1i fci/C21kandqk¼0 otherwise.\\nThe MPI requires deprivations of those already identiﬁed as\\nmultidimensionally poor to be aggregated across dimensions,\\nwhile neglecting the deprivations of those deemed non-poor (with\\nci<k). The censored deprivation score vector ciðkÞpreserves the\\nentries of ciwhen ci>kand takes the values of zero for all individ-\\nuals when ci<k.The multiplication of each row in g0by the iden-\\ntiﬁcation function qkcorresponds to the censored deprivation\\n13The MPI produces a multidimensional single summary measure of poverty (as\\nshown in the Stigliz Sen Fitoussi Commission Report – Stiglitz, Sen, & Fitoussi, 2009 )\\nand is based on the counting approach (as recommended by the Atkinson\\nCommission Report, 2017, rec 19 ). In contrast to the multidimensional alternatives,\\nthis index identiﬁes the poor and provides a single cardinal index to assess the degreeof poverty in the population. The fuzzy sets and axiomatic methods are exceptions tothis rule, but, to the best of our knowledge, there are no current poverty estimates forChile calculated using these methods.14It is impossible to reverse the methodology changes in 1996 and 2013. Regarding\\nthe urban/rural deﬁnition, before 1996, all localities with more than 2000 inhabitantswere considered urban. Thereafter, localities with 1000–2000 inhabitants wereconsidered urban if at least 50% of the active population was employed in thesecondary or tertiary economic sectors. Since 2013, the urban–rural divide has beendisregarded when calculating the poverty line. From 1992 to 2011, the calorie intake\\nthreshold was set at 2176 Kcal in urban areas and 2236 Kcal in rural areas. Starting in\\n2013, the threshold was set at 2000 Kcal per person. Finally, the Orshanksy coefﬁcientrose from 2 to 2.42, in 2013, the year in which the food basket was updated,economies of scale were introduced (n\\n0.7), and incomes were no longer adjusted to\\nnational accounts. Finally, there were more sources for imputing rental income (seeCASEN, 2013 ).S. Klasen, C.

In the aggregation step, the MPI (or M0)\\nis obtained by the multiplication of the mean g0kðÞand the number\\nof deprivations d:Analytically, M0¼lðg0kðÞ Þ is the MPI, which is\\nthe mean of the censored deprivation matrix. Note that M0is also\\nthe multidimensional headcount ratio (H) adjusted by the depriva-\\ntion intensity (A) suffered by the poor, or M0¼H/C2A(see Alkire &\\nFoster, 2011 ).\\nThis counting methodology employs a dual cutoff approach to\\nthe identiﬁcation of the poor. Firstly, it considers dimension-\\nspeciﬁc cutoffs ðzÞ, fulﬁlling the requirement of having depriva-\\ntion cutoffs for each dimension of an individual’s wellbeing\\n(see Bourguignon & Chakravarty, 2003 ). Then, it aggregates to\\nidentify the poor on the basis of the count of weighted depriva-\\ntions, given a poverty threshold kðÞ. The aggregation step does\\nnot lose information on dimension-speciﬁc deﬁcits. The dual cut-\\noff approach is a general framework when identifying the poor,in which the intersection approach (deprivation in all dimen-\\nsions, k¼d) as well as the union approach (deprivation in any\\ndimension k¼1) are special cases. One advantage of the MPI\\nover the Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis (MODA) is\\nthat it does not rely on the union approach and consequently\\nit is more ﬂexible when identifying the poor in a context of\\nnumerous dimensions. Moreover, and differently to MODA, MPI\\noffers the possibility of breaking down the index by dimension\\n(and by indicator within the dimensions). Additionally, the MPI\\nallows subgroup’s decomposition (using population shares as\\nweights).\\n15All these features allow the understanding of poverty\\npatterns across population subgroups.16\\nAlthough the MPI has desirable features, it requires research-\\ners to take the responsibility for their decisions regarding dimen-\\nsions, weights and cutoffs (opening the door to misjudgements).\\nMoreover, there are also some empirical issues related to its for-\\nmulation. For instance, changes in the weighting scheme can\\nproduce signiﬁcant changes in who is identiﬁed as poor\\n(Cavapozzi, Han, & Miniaci, 2015 ). It also neglects inequality\\namongst the poor, while it unequally treats deprivations below\\nthe second threshold as substitutes, and above this threshold\\nas complements ( Rippin, 2012; Dotter & Klasen, 2014 ). The strict\\nseparation between identiﬁcation and aggregation is less com-\\npelling than in the case of unidimensional poverty measurement\\nas the deprivation counting of poor households can already beseen as a form of aggregation. In the same way, it is possible\\nto see the identiﬁcation process not as a dichotomy but as a\\nquestion of degree ( Rippin, 2012; Dotter & Klasen, 2014 ). While\\nthe dual cutoff approach does not rule out the possibility of\\npotential trade-offs between deprivations ( Ravallion, 2011,\\n2012 ), it has empirical advantages over the intersection and\\nunion approaches when the number of indicators is large. It\\ncan be fed with an unlimited number of indicators, thereby sup-\\nporting a much broader deﬁnition of poverty, including cultur-\\nally speciﬁc concepts of poverty, which also makes it less\\nsensitive to misclassiﬁcations and mismeasurement ( Dotter &\\nKlasen, 2014 ).2.4. A historical multidimensional poverty index for Chile 1992–2017\\nIn the construction of an HMPI for 1992–2017, we adopt the\\nsame dimensions, dimension-speciﬁc cutoffs zðÞ;weights wðÞ;\\nand poverty cutoff kðÞthat the Ministry of Social Planning (Minis-\\nterio de Desarrollo Social) used in its ofﬁcial estimation of the mul-\\ntidimensional poverty index in 2013. The advantage of this\\napproach is that it makes achievements strictly comparable for\\nthe whole period 1992–2017 and thus, normative judgements\\nabout our Chilean HMPI can be avoided.\\n17Contrarily, the disadvan-\\ntage of doing this is that it reduces the amount of information nec-essary to create the achievement matrix Xwhile reproducing the\\nineligibility problem across indicators (by directly assuming that a\\nhousehold outside the reference population in one indicator is\\nnon-deprived in that indicator).\\nThe 2013 estimation of the Chilean MPI relies on the four\\ndimensions of education, health, employment and social protec-\\ntion, and living standards. Each dimension consists of three indica-\\ntors. The weights structure attaches equal importance to all\\ndimensions, and within each dimension, it is assumed that each\\nindicator is also equally important. Finally, the poverty cutoff\\nwas set at 0.25 implying that, if a household is deprived in 3 out\\nof 12 indicators, their members are classiﬁed as multidimension-\\nally poor.\\nTable 1 shows the structure of the index (including dimensions,\\ndeﬁnitions of deprivation by indicators, and weights as used here).\\nIt also includes the required deﬁnition departures of the indicator’s\\ndeﬁnitions from the ofﬁcial 2013 MPI. This guarantees a time-\\nconsistent estimation of the HMPI for the period 1992–2017.\\n2.5. Measures of overlap between the income and multidimensional\\npoverty approaches\\nTo assess the matches and mismatches between the monetary\\nand multidimensional approaches to the identiﬁcation of the poor,\\nwe use a measure of association or redundancy dubbed overlap R0\\nmeasure (see Alkire et al., 2015 ). The way this is calculated is illus-\\ntrated in the two-way contingency table below ( Table 2 ). Entries\\nPjj0\\n00andPjj0\\n11show the percentages of people being classiﬁed simul-\\ntaneously as non-poor and poor by both methods, respectively. Pjj0\\n10\\nandPjj0\\n01show the percentages of the population classiﬁed as mon-\\netarily poor but not multidimensionally poor and vice versa,\\nrespectively. The marginal distributions are Pj\\n1þfor the monetarily\\npoor,Pj\\n0þfor the monetarily non-poor, Pj0\\nþ1for the multidimension-\\nally poor and Pj0\\nþ0for the multidimensionally non-poor.\\nIf poverty measures are not independent, and at least one of the\\nheadcount ratios is different from zero, this measure depicts the\\npoverty identiﬁcation matches as a proportion of the minimum\\nof the marginal poverty rates.\\nR0¼Pjj0\\n11\\nmin½Pj0\\nþ1;Pj\\n1þ/C138ð1Þ\\nR0takes values from zero to unity. For instance, if the monetary\\npoverty headcount ratio is 10% and the multidimensional poverty\\nheadcount ratio is 22%, R0= 0.4 implies that 40% of the income\\npoor population is simultaneously multidimensionally poor.1815The subgroup’s contribution to overall poverty can be calculated as the subgroup\\npoverty level divided by the overall poverty level. Similarly, the percentage\\ncontribution of each dimension to total poverty corresponds to the weightedcensored headcount ratio divided by the overall poverty level as the MPI is equal tothe weighted average of the censored headcount ratios (the average of the mean ofthe columns of the censored deprivation matrix).\\n16For instance, Alkire and Seth (2011) , in a cross-country comparison, show that\\nwhile the Indian region of Madhya Pradesh and the Democratic Republic of the Congoshare the same MPI (0.39), the dimensional contributions strongly differ betweenboth populations. For instance, the contribution of nutrition to overall poverty inMadhya Pradesh reaches 21.6% while in the Democratic Republic of Congo it reachesonly 7.2%.17To assess the normative deﬁnitions is beyond the scope of this study, which is\\nfocused on the matches and mismatches in identifying the poor using two ofﬁcially\\naccepted and implemented estimation methodologies.\\n18An alternative interpretation of this overlap measure is that 60% of those who are\\nincome-poor are classiﬁed as non-multidimensionally poor.4 S. Klasen, C. Villalobos / World Development 130 (2020) 104944\\nIndependently of which method provides a smaller poverty head-\\ncount, R0values close to the unity (zero) implies high degree of coin-\\ncidence (discrepancy) in the identiﬁcation of the poor.\\n3. Trends in poverty, economic growth and social policies.\\nPoverty overlap trends, and HMPI household non-eligibility\\n3.1. Poverty trends\\nIn Chile, poverty reduction took place in a favourable macroeco-\\nnomic context. Fig. 1 depicts the headcount poverty trends in Chileover the period 1992–2017. The poverty trends calculated using\\nour HMPI tally with the ofﬁcial MPI estimates for the period in\\nwhich both multidimensional indices are available (2013–17).19\\nThe stagnation of the multidimensional poverty headcount between2015 and 2017 drew public attention, owing to the fact that in the\\nsame period, income poverty showed an impressive reduction from\\n11.7% to 8.6%. Such strong divergence in terms of poverty head-\\ncounts inﬂuenced the public debate as it was not clear how to inter-\\npret such dynamics or what index should be considered for the\\npurposes of social planning.\\n20Contributing to the disorientation in\\nhow to interpret these numbers, both poverty measures are ofﬁcially\\npublished by the government on the same day.\\nFig. 2 shows how the shares of the population have fared\\naccording to their income and multidimensional poverty status.\\nThe share of population, which is unambiguously non-poor\\nincreased steadily after 1992 and even faster after 2011. By con-\\ntrast, the share of population classiﬁed as unambiguously poor\\ndecreased steadily over the same period but at a declining rate.Table 1\\nHistorical Multidimensional Poverty Index (HMPI) for Chile 1992–2017: Dimensions, deprivation indicators, weights, and deﬁnition departures fr om the ofﬁcial 2013 MPI.\\nDimensions Deprivation indicators (People who live in households with the following characteristics) Weights (%)\\nEducation 25\\nChildren’s school attendance Households where there is at least one child or adolescent aged 4– 18 not attending school and who has not yet\\ngraduated (after completing 12 years of schooling).

From 2003 onwards, the legal minimumwas 12 years of schooling.

Thus, childrenaged 0–5 are the common denominator.25/3\\nInsurance Households where there is at least one person who does not have any health insurance, either public or private\\n(including complementary insurance). Departure from the 2013 indicator deﬁnition: the information on\\ncomplementary health insurance is excluded because in 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, CASENdoes not provide such information.25/3\\nAccess Households where there is at least one woman aged 21 or above who has not completed a pap test during the past\\n3 years. Departure from the 2013 indicator deﬁnition: the original 2013 deﬁnition considers households to be\\ndeprived if there is at least one household member who suffered a health problem in the last 3 months and did notreceive treatment, or if in the last 12 months he/she has been receiving health treatment but this has not beencovered by the health system’s warranty (AUGE-GES). This complex deﬁnition is impossible to reproduce, as therelevant programmes were created in 2005 and the recall time has changed continually since 2000. The solutionwas to select the pap test indicator for this dimension, as it can be consistently estimated from 1992 to 2017.25/3\\nEmployment and social protection 25\\nEmployment Households with at least one member aged 18 or above being unemployed and not attending school.

Economic growth and social policies in Chile\\nSince the return of democracy in the early 1990s, the Chilean\\neconomy has experienced the longest period of economic growth\\never. According to World Bank data, annual economic growth aver-\\naged 4.6% during the whole period 1992–2017. During the sub-\\nperiods 1992–2000, 2000–09, and 2009–17, annual economic\\ngrowth averaged 5.5%, 4.2%, and 3.0%, respectively (see Table 3\\nbelow). According to Ffrench-Davis (2018) , the export-led period\\n1990–2007 was characterized by low inﬂation rates and the pro-\\ngressive liberalisation of capital and exchange markets. This\\nmacroeconomic set-up allowed the export of goods to grow at\\nannual rates of 9.6%, 6.4% during the periods 1990–98 and 1999–\\n2007, respectively. Differently, after the 2008 Global Economic Cri-\\nsis, the export of goods grew at a modest annual rate of 0.5%.Ffrench-Davis (2018) argues that these dynamics were the conse-\\nquence of changes in the macroeconomic environment (exchange\\nterms and commodity prices) rather than of structural macroeco-\\nnomic changes of the economy.\\nAlong with 1992–2017 macroeconomic stability, social policies\\nunderwent signiﬁcant transformations starting in the early 2000s.\\nBased on the Esping-Andersen’s (1990, 1999) welfare regime\\napproach, the welfare regime shifted from ‘conservative/informal’\\nto ‘liberal/informal’ because its continued reliance on market pro-\\nvision (with weak job protection) together with the progressive\\nintroduction of social assistance (see Barrientos, 2009, 2011,\\n2014 ). In 2002, The Chile Solidario , a comprehensive anti-poverty\\nprogram, was introduced. This program has three main compo-\\nnents. (i) The Family Support component aimed to identify and\\novercome the adverse circumstances that retain households in\\npoverty, (ii) the preferential access to social services and programs\\nin health, education and housing conditions, and (iii) subsidies to\\nincrease household income, some of them being conditional tothe fulﬁlment of children’s education and health goals (see\\nLarrañaga, Contreras, & Cabezas, 2015 for a detailed description\\nof this program). In the same vein, an individualistic unemploy-\\nment insurance program was introduced in 2002 which was suc-\\ncessively reformed to incorporate solidaristic components ( Ewig\\n& Kay, 2011; Ramos & Acero, 2015 ). In the same year, a plan for\\nuniversal access with explicit guarantees in health (AUGE) was\\nintroduced (see Ewig & Kay, 2011 for details about this program).\\nThese and other reforms introduced during the 2000s we accompa-\\nnied by a progressive increase in public expenditure on education\\n(Contreras & Ffrench-Davis, 2014 ).\\nAlthough the mentioned programs do not represent an exhaus-\\ntive list of the changing social policy paradigm, they are enough to\\ncharacterize the emergence of new forms of social assistance (con-\\nditional income transfer programmes, social pensions, public\\nworks, integrated anti-poverty programmes) that complemented\\nthe role of the labour market in providing welfare protection\\n(Barrientos, 2009 ). The shift originated from the disappointing\\nresults of the Washington consensus policies ( Cornia, 2014;\\nRoberts, 2014 ). It is important to point out that the changes in\\nsocial policy are not restricted to Chile, but a it is a more general\\ntrend, under all types of political regimes, particularly in many\\nmiddle-income countries.\\nThe mix of impressive but declining economic growth rates\\nover the period 1992–2017 together with the deepening and\\nbroadening social policies started in the early 2000s can explain\\nthe strong poverty reduction over the same period as shown in\\nFig. 1 . This piece of evidence is compatible with the common ﬁnd-\\ning on the macroeconomic level that there is poverty reduction\\nthrough growth and redistribution policies ( Belke & Wernet,\\n2015 ). However, the rates of economic growth are heterogeneously\\nassociated to the poverty reduction following the different mea-\\nsures employed in this study. To investigate this issue, Table 3\\nshows the dissimilar rates of change in HMPI, income poverty\\nand severe income poverty and their interactions with economic\\ngrowth for the sub-periods 1992–2000, 2000–09, and 2009–17.\\nOver the whole period, the average growth elasticity of mone-\\ntary poverty is about two times higher than the growth elasticity.551\\n.488 .489 .486\\n.452\\n.43.418\\n.385\\n.359\\n.324\\n.308 .309.329\\n.276\\n.232.217.202\\n.187\\n.137.151 .148 .144\\n.117\\n.086 .09.076\\n.057 .056 .056.047.032 .037.029.045.035.0230 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6Poverty headcount ratio\\n1991 1994 1997 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015 2018\\nYear\\nMultidimensionally poor Income−poor\\nSeverely income−poor\\nFig. 1.

In absolute terms, the period 2000–2009\\nexhibits greater reduction in multidimensional poverty along with\\neconomic growth. This can be the result of economic growth rates\\nabove population growth rates together with the deepening and\\nbroadening of social policies, as mentioned earlier. These social\\npolicies will also likely affect the degree of overlap between mon-\\netary and multidimensional poverty. Prior to the enactment of\\nthese social policies, progress in multidimensional poverty is\\nlinked mostly to rising incomes, likely leading to a greater overlap\\nbetween monetary and multidimensional poverty. After the intro-\\nduction of these social policies, progress in multidimensional pov-erty is more related to these social policies, likely reducing the\\noverlap. So, we expect the overlap to fall over time, which we\\nnow investigate in more detail.\\n3.3. Household characteristics and demographics and the two-way\\npoverty status\\nTable 4 presents summary information on the household char-\\nacteristics and demographics of those households classiﬁed as\\npoor, both ambiguously (either monetarily or multidimensionally)\\nand unambiguously. For the four cohorts presented in Table 4 ,a\\ngreater gap in mean characteristics and demographics is observed\\namongst the income-poor households, depending on their multidi-mensional poverty status. The socio-demographic gaps between\\nthe two groups of multidimensionally poor households (the\\nincome-poor and the non-income-poor) are less pronounced. In\\nother words, amongst the same group of (ambiguously and unam-\\nbiguously poor) households, there is a higher unconditional corre-\\nlation between multidimensional poverty and disadvantaging\\nhousehold characteristics and demographics. Then, as expected,\\nthe multidimensional poverty approach seems to identify house-\\nholds with a priori more adverse non-income circumstances. This\\nﬁnding is highly relevant for the design of poverty alleviation poli-\\ncies, as it shows that targeting programmes solely at income-poor\\nhouseholds can leave behind the worst-off families while inadver-\\ntently focusing on the less deprived ones.\\n3.4. Poverty overlap: multidimensional and income poverty\\nWhile informative, the dynamics in Fig. 2 , do not say anything\\nabout whether those households identiﬁed as poor or non-poor\\nby each method are the same ones or not.

Using this\\nalternative measure, the poverty overlap trends remain very similar.S. Klasen, C. Villalobos / World Development 130 (2020) 104944 7\\nThe 1990s decade is characterized by high rates of market-\\ndriven economic growth and the implementation of deep liberal\\nmacroeconomic reforms.22In this decade, the level of association\\nbetween the two poverty identiﬁcation methods remained almost\\nunchanged. From 2000 onwards, a period characterized by slower\\neconomic growth but accompanied by more comprehensive social\\npolicies, the overlap declined, as hypothesized, unambiguously and\\nindependently of the considered poverty measure.23\\nAs the monetary poverty headcount ratio is strictly smaller than\\nthe multidimensional poverty headcount ratio over the whole per-\\niod 1992–2017, the overlap R0measure represents the percentage\\nof those monetarily poor people who are at the same time multidi-mensionally poor. From 1992 to 2000, the poverty overlap remains\\nunchanged at the same level around 70%. It implies that about 30%\\nof those deemed monetarily poor were not multidimensionally\\npoor.\\n24\\nThe story dramatically changes during the 2000s as already in\\n2009, the same redundancy measures reached 58% (monetary\\nand multidimensional poverty) and 61% (severe monetary and\\nmultidimensional poverty), respectively. The overlap reduction\\ncontinued until 2017 year in which only about 49% of both, the\\nincome, and the severe income poor were simultaneously identi-\\nﬁed as multidimensionally poor.To address the concern that the poverty overlap trends in Fig. 3\\ncan be affected by compositional changes within the population\\nidentiﬁed as income-poor, we raise the income poverty line to\\nmatch the monetary poverty headcount ratio to the multidimen-\\nsional poverty headcount ratio. We do this in Table 5 , dividing\\nthe whole period in three sub-periods, namely 1992–2000, 2000–\\n09 and 2009–17.25While the overlap levels are somewhat different,\\nthe declining poverty overlap trend holds.\\nTable 6 shows the annualized relative rate of change of the\\noverlap R0measure for a set of population subgroups based on\\nhousehold composition and its spatial distribution.26We ﬁnd that\\nthe declining association of the poverty identiﬁcation measures hap-pens in all population subgroups for the whole period 1992–2017,\\nbeing more pronounced from 2000 onwards. Although some hetero-\\ngeneity is observed during the 1990s, the evidence supports the idea\\nthat the declining poverty overlap is a general dynamic, with speeds\\nof reduction varying somewhat across population subgroups.\\n3.5. Multidimensional poverty and non-eligible households\\nA signiﬁcant empirical concern relates to the fact that the pov-\\nerty overlap can be affected by the presence of non-eligible house-\\nholds within some HMPI indicators (see Dotter & Klasen, 2014 ).Table 4\\nCharacteristics of households according to their poverty classiﬁcation, Chile: 1992, 2000, 2009, and 2017.\\nHousehold characteristics and demographics Multidimensionally poor Income-poor and multidimensionally\\nnon-poorIncome-poor Income non-poor\\nMean Lin.

However, to maintain the time\\ncomparability, we based the whole study on the 13 administrative regions thatexisted in 1992. The population subgroups under consideration are the zone (urban/rural), the 13 old administrative regions, whether the household head is elderly, thesize of the household, and the education proﬁle of the adult household members.8 S. Klasen, C. Villalobos / World Development 130 (2020) 104944\\nThe ofﬁcial MPI is built upon 12 indicators and, in 8 of them, there\\nare households which are by default treated as non-deprived\\nbecause they have no eligible members. Table 7 shows that the\\nhousehold non-eligibility across HMPI indicators varies according\\nto changes in the demographic structure of the population. For\\ninstance, the non-eligible population in the nutrition indicator,\\nthat is the proportion of households without children aged 0–5,\\nincreases from 49.8% in 1992 to 71.3% in 2017. Consequently, the\\nlikelihood of classifying a random household as deprived in this\\ndimension has decreased sharply over the past 25 years. Thus,\\nchanges in the nutrition indicator not only convey information\\non improved nutrition but also on the increasing non-eligibility\\nin this indicator.27\\nA second related issue is that the non-eligibility can happen in\\nmany indicators simultaneously. For example, households with no\\nmembers aged 18 or below are by default classiﬁed as non-\\ndeprived in the school attendance, schooling gap and nutrition\\nindicators. The eligibility problem gets even worse for households\\nthat additionally have no elderly members, as they are non-\\ndeprived in one-third of the indicators. In fact, the median house-hold is ineligible in two out of twelve indicators, and the popula-\\ntion share which is ineligible in three or more indicators has\\nincreased steadily since 2000. Surprisingly, only a modest 3% to\\n4% of the population is fully eligible. Consequently, our empirical\\nanalysis needs to control for the fact that the declining poverty\\noverlap may reﬂect demographic changes rather than a genuine\\ndiverging poverty identiﬁcation process.\\nTo assess the degree to which this measurement constraint\\naffects the overlapping trend between the poverty measures, we\\ncalculate the overlap R0measure for the same type of non-\\neligible household according to its demographic composition.\\nFig. 4 shows overlap R0measures between income and multidi-\\nmensional poverty for households without children aged ﬁve or\\nunder (top left), households without children aged 6–18 (top\\nright), households without women aged 21 or above (bottom left),\\nand households without elderly people (bottom right).2895% con-\\nﬁdence intervals show that the declining overlap between multidi-\\nmensional and income poverty follows almost the same pattern in\\nhouseholds with different sources of non-eligibility. That is, the\\noverlap measure remains stable during the 1990s and early 2000s,\\nand then it decreases sharply..711.719.707.734\\n.699\\n.659\\n.639\\n.578\\n.525\\n.512.501\\n.489.788.808 .807 .805.796\\n.772\\n.701\\n.602\\n.575 .578\\n.542\\n.506.4 .5 .6 .7 .8 .9Overlap R0 measure\\n1991 1994 1997 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015 2018\\nYear\\nIncome and MD poor Severely income and MD poor\\nFig. 3.

As the population gets older, a higher proportion of eligible households areexpected. In the mid-1990s about 75% of the population lived in ineligible householdsfor this indicator.

Two-way ﬁxed-effect regression of poverty overlap on education,\\ndemographic variables, and type and depth of the non-eligibility at the\\nprovince level\\nIn this section, we employ a two-way ﬁxed-effect regression at\\nthe province level to detect the factors associated with theobserved variability of the overlap R\\n0measure.30As explanatory\\nvariables, we considered province proportions or province averages\\nin household characteristics, household composition, rurality, and\\nnon-eligibility.31Household characteristics are represented by the\\nyears of education of the head of household. The demographic vari-\\nables are the proportion of one-person households, the proportion of\\nadults in the households, the proportion of female-headed house-\\nholds and the mean household size. Rurality is measured by the pro-\\nportion of population living in rural households. The non-eligibility\\nproﬁle of the household is controlled by indicators capturing by\\nthe proportion of households with a demographic proﬁle that makesthem non-eligible in different indicators (quality of non-eligibility)\\nand by the average number of indicators in which provincial house-\\nholds are non-eligible (depth of non-eligibility). We also include\\nmacroeconomic controls (unemployment rate, share of agricultural\\nemployment, and mean household income), and, in line with the\\nfundamental export decline after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis,\\nwe include interactions of the post crisis periods with the explana-\\ntory variables of interest.32\\nThe results in Table 8 show that all considered variables are cor-\\nrelated with the unconditional poverty overlap variation across\\nprovinces. However, conditional models (9) and (10) show that\\nonly the education of the household head, rurality and householdsize are signiﬁcantly associated to the overlap level. The higher\\nthe education of the household head, the lower the poverty over-\\nlap. This is expected, as education should be positively correlated\\nwith other functionings, while the correlation with income seems.657.67.654.675\\n.649\\n.607\\n.583\\n.514\\n.466 .472\\n.439.449.2 .4 .6 .8Overlap R0 measure\\n1991 1996 2001 2006 2011 2016\\nHouseholds without children below 5.686.677.714\\n.673.701\\n.625.647\\n.546\\n.513 .514\\n.45.494.2 .4 .6 .8\\n1991 1996 2001 2006 2011 2016\\nHouseholds without children aged 6−18\\n.624.677.705\\n.679 .68\\n.651\\n.474\\n.444.431.419\\n.298.344.2 .4 .6 .8Overlap R0 measure\\n1991 1996 2001 2006 2011 2016\\nHouseholds without womem aged 21+.685.694.672.706\\n.67\\n.623\\n.595\\n.536\\n.484.466 .467\\n.439.2 .4 .6 .8\\n1991 1996 2001 2006 2011 2016\\nHouseholds without elderly people\\nFig. 4.

The result of thisspeciﬁcation test show that there is correlation between the errors and the regressorsresulting in biased coefﬁcients (Prob>chi2 = 0.0326). Consequently, we reject the null\\nhypothesis that the difference in coefﬁcients is not systematic. This result supports\\nour prior decision to estimate a ﬁxed effect model which provides consistentestimates of the associations.\\n31The province-level variables correspond to population-weighted means.32Using a Chow test, we tested for a structural break starting in 2009 due to the\\neffects of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). We ﬁrst regressed the model withdummies pre and post 2008 GFC and all their (pre and post) interactions with thevariables of our previously preferred model. Then, we test for equality of thecoefﬁcients of dummies and slopes jointly with previously tested hypotheses. The testyields an F-statistic F (13, 42) = 3.22; Prob > F = 0.0020. This evidence conﬁrms thatthere is a structural break at 1% level of signiﬁcance in 2009. Alternatively, we tested\\nfor a structural break without knowing the year of a potential structural break. We\\ntake advantage of the -contrast- Stata postestimation command to investigate thisissue taking as reference the year of 1992. The procedure reveals a structural break in2009. Finally, we apply a test for the joint signiﬁcance of all post 2008 GFCinteractions, and we ﬁnd that they are jointly signiﬁcant. The result is a F-statistic F(11, 42) = 3.55; Prob > F = 0.0014.S.

Moreover, it is directly included as an indicator in the MPI.\\nBy contrast, rurality seems to be more associated to the generation\\nof lower incomes and to a reduced functionings achievement. This\\nbeing a consequence of the relative incompleteness of markets and\\nrelative under provision of public goods in rural areas. Thus,\\nincome poverty and multidimensional poverty are more likely to\\ngo hand-in-hand there. Similar evidence is also found in Klasen\\n(2000) for South Africa during the 1990s (see also Lipton, 1978;\\nvan de Walle & Nead, 1995 ).\\nWe conﬁrm the positive linkage between demographics and\\npoverty ( Lipton, 1983; Klasen, 2000; Merrick, 2002 ). The idea that\\nlarger families are on average poorer and less able to invest in edu-cation, as well as being less capable of functioning, is conﬁrmed at\\nthis aggregation level. Following Libois and Somville (2018) , the\\ncomplex relationship between fertility and household size can\\nexplain the non-signiﬁcant coefﬁcient of the proportion of adults\\nin the households, as higher birth rates are associated with larger\\nhousehold sizes.\\nNone of the non-eligibility indicators appear to be signiﬁcant.\\nBy contrasting the estimated coefﬁcients with those in the robust-\\nness speciﬁcation in the third column in Table 6.A in the appendix,\\nwe see, however, that to neglect the non-eligibility issue produces\\nan upward bias in the coefﬁcient of household size.\\nInterestingly, the mean provincial per capita household\\nincome is not correlated with the overlap after controlling for\\nhousehold education, rurality and household size. At this level\\nof aggregation, the level of income seems to be uncorrelated\\nwith the proportion of income poor households that are simulta-\\nneously multidimensionally poor. Contrarily, and as expected,the unemployment rate is positively associated to the overlap\\nlevel.\\n33\\nComparing the models estimated based on alternative poverty\\noverlap deﬁnitions, we conﬁrm that this redundancy measure\\ndepends on the level of poverty identiﬁed by both methods as they\\ncan capture different household mixtures. However, when using\\nthe severe poverty line, the condition of rurality is still associated\\nto higher overlap levels.34\\nIn Chile, the rise in the number of small households, the fall in\\nthe share of the rural population, and the increase in the level of\\neducation of heads, are the factors that can account for a large\\nshare of the decline in the overlap over time. The unsaturatedmodel (i.e. the model with these three variables) has an adjusted\\nR-squared of 0.66.\\n35One might expect that the diverging identiﬁca-\\ntion of the poor is likely to occur in more countries for two reasons.\\nFirst, due to the fact that in developing countries, the fall in fertility\\nrates has reduced household sizes nearly everywhere ( UN, 2017 )..919.93.927.908.926\\n.895.88.907\\n.853\\n.814.839\\n.792.2 .4 .6 .8Overlap R0 measure\\n1991 1999 2007 2015\\nHHs eligible in all indicators.747.743.739.785\\n.735\\n.698.683\\n.653\\n.586\\n.557.591\\n.557.2 .4 .6 .8\\n1991 1999 2007 2015\\nHHs eligible in all indicators but 1.683.692\\n.66.695\\n.661\\n.617.606\\n.537\\n.499.485.483.464.2 .4 .6 .8\\n1991 1999 2007 2015\\nHHs eligible in all indicators but 2\\n.677.721.706.708\\n.678\\n.642\\n.6\\n.567\\n.49.553\\n.471.498.2 .4 .6 .8Overlap R0 measure\\n1991 1999 2007 2015\\nHHs eligible in all indicators but 3.602.631\\n.593.646\\n.595.611\\n.5\\n.452\\n.388.427\\n.395.402.2 .4 .6 .8\\n1991 1999 2007 2015\\nHHs eligible in all indicators but 4.596\\n.503.628\\n.504.615\\n.446.466\\n.383.388\\n.361\\n.31.371.2 .4 .6 .8\\n1991 1999 2007 2015\\nHHs eligible in all indicators but 5 or more\\nFig. 5.

That is, between severe income poverty and multidi-mensional poverty ( Table 3.A ) and between the adjusted income poverty and the\\nmultidimensional poverty ( Table 4.A ).Table 5.A shows that neither unemployment\\nnor household income are signiﬁcantly associated to the poverty overlap betweenincome poverty and the adjusted multidimensional poverty headcount (by decreasingthe poverty cutoff k).\\n34This ﬁnding is also robust to the exclusion of time dummies and non-eligibility\\ncontrols reported in robustness Appendix Table 6.A .\\n35SeeFigs. 3.A and 4.A in the appendix for the evolution of the population share\\nliving in rural areas and the shares of population living in households of differentsizes.12 S.

Villalobos / World Development 130 (2020) 104944\\nThis, together with ongoing rural–urban migration processes ( IOM,\\n2015 ) that can be reinforced by climate shocks ( Nawrotski et al.,\\n2017 ). Second, because in many middle-income countries the expan-\\nsion of education, and the provision of public goods and social sup-\\nport policies in rural areas are likely to occur due to the argued shift\\nin public policies.\\n4.2. Poverty overlap at the household level\\nGiven the poverty headcounts in Chile over the past 25 years,\\nthe overlap R0measure corresponds to the proportion of income-\\npoor households that are simultaneously multidimensionally poor.\\nThis deﬁnition allows us to investigate the probability that an\\nincome-poor household is simultaneously multidimensionally\\npoor. We do this by means of a logit probability model for the\\n1992, 2000, 2009 and 2017 cohorts (see Table 7.A in the appendix).\\nBesides household characteristics and composition, the logit model\\ncontrols for province ﬁxed effects, the type and depth of the house-\\nhold non-eligibility and the income level of the household. Table 9\\nshows the marginal effects at the mean characteristics.\\nWe ﬁnd that income-poor households are less likely to be mul-\\ntidimensionally poor if they have a higher stock of education, if\\nthey consist of a single person, and if they have higher income\\nlevels. However, the correlation between the level of household\\nincome and the poverty overlap is unimportant. For instance, dou-bling the income level of a household is associated with a reduc-\\ntion in the probability of its occupants being multidimensionally\\npoor of 4.99%, 8.78%, 3.17%, and 4.25% in 1992, 2000, 2009, and\\n2017, respectively.36On the other hand, rural and larger households\\nare more likely to also be multidimensionally poor. On average, an\\nincome-poor household located in a rural location is about 15 to\\n20% more likely to be multidimensionally poor than an income-\\npoor household in an urban area with the same income level.37\\nOur results show a reduction in the rural bias since the early\\n2000s which is signiﬁcant at the 1% level between 2000 and\\n2017. This positive trend can be explained by better-functioning\\nand export-oriented agriculture, as well as the introduction of pub-\\nlic policies devoted to improving the quality of life in areas that lag\\nbehind (see IFAD, 2016 ).38Finally, as expected, the non-eligibility of\\nhouseholds across indicators does affect the probability of income-\\npoor households of being simultaneously multidimensionally poor.Table 8\\nTwo-way ﬁxed-effect regression of poverty overlap on education and demographic variables at the province level.\\nExplanatory variable/model Overlap R0measure: Income poverty and multidimensional poverty\\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10)\\nEducation of head of household (years) /C00.102***\\n(0.00537)/C00.0237*\\n(0.0135)/C00.0302**\\n(0.0147)\\nOne-person household /C05.389*** 0.968 0.931\\n(0.518) (0.579) (0.582)\\nProportion of adults in the household /C02.152*** /C00.294 /C00.332\\n(0.125) (0.573) (0.568)\\nHousehold size 0.245*** 0.0886** 0.0835**\\n(0.0123) (0.0400) (0.0411)\\nSingle-female-headed household /C01.716*** 0.0768 0.0856\\n(0.131) (0.236) (0.240)\\nRural household 0.847*** 0.199** 0.217**\\n(0.0839) (0.0957) (0.105)\\nDepth of non-eligibility (%) /C01.215 /C00.578 /C00.758\\n(0.845) (0.877) (0.923)\\nHH without children aged 5 or below (%) 0.196\\n(0.130)0.108\\n(0.198)0.156\\n(0.196)\\nHH without children aged 6–18 (%) 1.105***\\n(0.307)/C00.0685\\n(0.453)/C00.130\\n(0.456)\\nHH without elderly people (%) 0.419** 0.235 0.203\\n(0.159) (0.167) (0.170)\\nHH without women aged 21+ (%) /C02.049** /C00.0279 /C00.0985\\n(0.762) (0.766) (0.766)\\nShare of employment in the agricultural\\nsector0.784**\\n(0.312)/C00.104\\n(0.328)\\nLog of per capita household income /C00.158*** 0.0371\\n(0.0139) (0.0333)\\nUnemployment rate 1.724** 1.107**\\n(0.660) (0.431)\\nConstant 1.510*** 0.822*** 2.113*** /C00.472*** 0.947*** 0.435*** 1.897** 2.370*** 0.689 0.518\\n(0.0468) (0.0194) (0.0864) (0.0549) (0.0249) (0.0184) (0.896) (0.176) (1.024) (1.141)\\nTime dummies and Post GFC interactions – – – – – – – – Yes Yes\\nF-test (model) 21.15 9.335 18.94 20.86 13.55 5.580 19.35 17.38 21.85 22.20\\nDF 43 43 43 43 43 43 47 45 71 74\\nR-squared 0.609 0.401 0.602 0.617 0.504 0.268 0.622 0.604 0.718 0.721SSM (model) 5.543 3.650 5.481 5.612 4.585 2.439 5.656 5.496 6.533 6.558SSE (error/residual) 3.557 5.450 3.619 3.488 4.516 6.661 3.444 3.605 2.567 2.543Root MSE (SEE) 0.0832 0.103 0.0839 0.0824 0.0937 0.114 0.0822 0.0839 0.0727 0.0726Effect Test 8.104 4.193 5.168 6.476 3.740 2.911 4.510 4.413 3.668 3.091Number of Observations 516 516 516 516 516 516 516 516 516 516\\nNote: Robust standard errors in parentheses. ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.1.

We have\\nexplored at different levels of aggregation the degree of association\\nin the identiﬁcation of the poor between the utilitarian approach\\nand the capability approach (implemented using the standardmonetary FGT measure and the Alkire-Foster method, respec-\\ntively). We have empirically addressed the issue of non-eligibility\\nof households across indicators of the MPI, aiming to understand\\nthe factors behind the poverty overlap divergence in Chile during\\nthe past 25 years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest\\ntrend comparison of identiﬁcation outcomes brought about by\\nsuch different and highly relevant approaches.\\nWe ﬁnd that the overlap between the identiﬁcation of the poor\\nfollowing the multidimensional and monetary measures, ordinary\\nand severe, have declined over the past 25 years at a rate of about\\n1.5% and 1.75% respectively per year. While the overlap decline\\nwas almost non-existent during the 1990s, a decade of rapid eco-\\nnomic growth, it was remarkably pronounced during the period\\n2000–17, a period which was characterized by lower economic\\ngrowth and the introduction and deepening of social policies. The\\ndecline in the level of association between the two poverty mea-\\nsures is robust in alternative overlap deﬁnitions, but it is still\\naffected by the non-eligibility of households across some MPI\\nindicators.\\nTwo sets of estimates were produced to investigate the correla-\\ntion between socioeconomic characteristics, household composi-\\ntion, and location, and the observed poverty association measure.The ﬁrst set of estimates was based on a province-level panel\\nﬁxed-effect model, and the second was obtained using different\\ncross-sections to study the association of the poverty measures\\nat the household level by means of a logit model. We have shown\\nthat in both estimates, the household non-eligibility across indica-\\ntors of the HMPI is a relevant empirical issue, as it has the potential\\nto bias the true underlying impacts on the poverty overlap ﬁgures.\\nThe strong empirical result of this research is that the level of\\nhousehold education, the rural location of a household and the\\nhousehold size are correlated with the degree in which both pov-\\nerty measures identify the same poor population.\\nIncome poor household with higher education levels may have\\nbetter access to public services and social programs, particularly\\nsince the 2000s, in health, education and housing, allowing them\\nto achieve key functionings, and thus having a lower probability\\nof being multidimensionally poor, despite insufﬁcient levels of\\nincome.\\nRurality is positively associated to the level of association\\nbetween poverty measures. The lack of agglomeration in rural\\nareas generates on the one hand a relative deﬁcit in the provision\\nof public services and less generous social programs, and, on the\\nother hand, it constraints the access to markets. Consequently,\\nincome poor households are in a relative disadvantage in achieving\\nkey functionings and therefore, income and multidimensional pov-\\nerty are more likely to go hand-in-hand there.\\nWe ﬁnd that the demographic component is also relevant in\\nexplaining the diverging identiﬁcation of the poor since larger\\nhouseholds ﬁnd it relatively more difﬁcult to improve their\\nfunctionings.Table 9\\nMarginal effects (at means) after complex survey logit estimation.\\nVariable|Year Overlap at the Household Level /C0dy=dx\\n1992 2000 2009 2017\\nAvg. years of education of adults in the HH /C00.0799*** /C00.0855*** /C00.0800*** /C00.0807*** /C00.0777*** /C00.0741*** /C00.0662*** /C00.0588***\\n(0.00440) (0.00447) (0.00570) (0.00556) (0.00441) (0.00440) (0.00413) (0.00511)\\nOne-person household /C00.276*** /C00.337*** /C00.212** /C00.236*** /C00.208*** /C00.211*** /C00.0785* /C00.0665*\\n(0.0772) (0.0622) (0.0866) (0.0581) (0.0477) (0.0441) (0.0457) (0.0399)\\nHH head is elderly 0.0188 0.0314 /C00.0419 /C00.0297 /C00.0264 /C00.0189 /C00.0697* /C00.0552\\n(0.0430) (0.0469) (0.0456) (0.0451) (0.0426) (0.0419) (0.0396) (0.0348)\\nHH head is female 0.0458** 0.0474** 0.111*** 0.123*** 0.0431** 0.0382* /C00.00144 /C04.53e-05\\n(0.0198) (0.0220) (0.0237) (0.0259) (0.0211) (0.0212) (0.0225) (0.0201)\\nHousehold size 0.0779*** 0.0809*** 0.0879*** 0.0874*** 0.105*** 0.101*** 0.0835*** 0.0691***\\n(0.00762) (0.00806) (0.00869) (0.00939) (0.0101) (0.0103) (0.0100) (0.0106)\\nRural household 0.188*** 0.190*** 0.237*** 0.228*** 0.211*** 0.192*** 0.156*** 0.146***\\n(0.0195) (0.0233) (0.0162) (0.0231) (0.0227) (0.0252) (0.0245) (0.0246)\\nNumber of indicators in which the HH is non-eligible 0.0183\\n(0.0117)0.0101\\n(0.0132)0.00170\\n(0.0140)/C00.0160\\n(0.0145)/C00.0544***\\n(0.0121)/C00.0606***\\n(0.0124)/C00.0418***\\n(0.0138)/C00.0430***\\n(0.0126)\\nHH without children aged 5 or below 0.137*** 0.136*** 0.0823*** 0.0789*** 0.0427* 0.0366 0.0773*** 0.0655***\\n(0.0169) (0.0184) (0.0226) (0.0229) (0.0233) (0.0234) (0.0250) (0.0232)\\nHH without children aged 5–18 /C00.0669 /C00.0894* /C00.0935** /C00.130*** /C00.237*** /C00.245*** /C00.206*** /C00.199***\\n(0.0412) (0.0462) (0.0410) (0.0459) (0.0406) (0.0421) (0.0387) (0.0380)\\nHH without elderly people 0.0936** 0.103** 0.163*** 0.182*** 0.0803* 0.0786* 0.175*** 0.158***\\n(0.0379) (0.0423) (0.0405) (0.0465) (0.0438) (0.0440) (0.0432) (0.0412)\\nHH without women aged 21+ /C00.0348 /C00.0558 /C00.153*** /C00.192*** /C00.0904 /C00.0854 0.0339 0.0256\\n(0.0426) (0.0456) (0.0440) (0.0575) (0.0615) (0.0641) (0.0556) (0.0486)\\nLog of the household income /C00.0859*** /C00.151*** /C00.0546*** – /C00.0731***\\n(0.0224) (0.0188) (0.0163) – (0.0232)\\nProvince Controls Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\\nObservations (Households) 35,939 64,925 70,748 70,666\\nPopulation size 13,330,843 14,959,739 16,375,919 17,737,520Sub Population Observations 10,655 13,429 9,934 5,719Sub Population Size 4,258,759 2,993,033 2,474,368 1,472,235\\nF 16.67 16.79 13.99 14.29 28.99 16.24 9.54 9.56\\nProb > F 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000\\nAdjusted Wald Test (Model) 1.558 1.602 1.472 0.823 1.630 0.866 0.402 0.514\\nGoodness-of-ﬁt test\\na0.122 0.111 0.152 0.595 0.107 0.555 0.935 0.865\\nNote: Robust standard errors in parentheses. ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.1.aWe report the F-adjusted mean residual test following Archer and Lemeshow (2006) running the\\n-svylogitgof- command after -svy:logit- in Stata 15.1.

Villalobos / World Development 130 (2020) 104944\\nThe key conclusion of this study is that the poverty overlap\\ndecline is a real process, in which the misidentiﬁcation of the poor\\nis not randomly distributed across the population. Therefore, an\\nunderstanding of this divergence is crucial, as poverty alleviation\\ninitiatives are partially based on poverty statistics. The fact that\\nhousehold education, household size, and a rural location are\\nbehind the observed divergence in Chile over the past 25 years,\\nraises the question of how general this process is. On the basis of\\nour results, we argue that this could be happening in more coun-\\ntries. In many developing countries, demographic transitions lead-\\ning to the reduction of the household size and rural–urban\\nmigration are ongoing processes, while in many middle-income\\ncountries, the expansion of education, and the provision of public\\ngoods in rural areas are likely to occur due to the argued shift in\\npublic policies.\\nDeclarations of interest\\nNone.CRediT authorship contribution statement\\nStephan Klasen: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation,\\nFormal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review & editing, Supervi-\\nsion.

Multidimensional poverty is coherent with the concept of\\nsocial exclusion [1] [14], which is the target of modern welfare policies and which\\nalso represents a key element within the debate on alternative welfare measures to\\nGDP.\\nNotwithstanding the general consensus about the multidimensional view of\\npoverty, its quantitative measurement is frequently operated on the basis of a sin-\\ngle indicator, usually the income, thus implying that the empirical assessments of\\nunidimensional and multidimensional approach generally coincide.\\nIn this case, the multidimensional approach would be an elegant and theoretically\\nuseful development, without the need to implement it empirically. Since the unidi-\\nmensional indicator is extremely simpler and faster to calculate, if it is also fully\\ninformative, it represents a suitable solution for the measurement of poverty. When,\\non the other hand, the two approaches indicate two different sets of poor units, it is\\nimportant to evaluate the different information contained in the two sets [5].\\nOur main contribution is to compare the sets of poor units deﬁned by traditional\\nunidimensional and multidimensional approach. For this purpose we develop a rank\\ncorrelation analysis, able to investigate in depth the similarities between the different\\nindicators.\\nA relevant implication of the multidimensional approach is the opportunity to\\ndivide total population not simply into just two subgroups, poor and non poor, as\\nit is done with poverty lines, but to detect a multiplicity of populations subgroups,\\neach related to different poverty levels, gradually moving from the completely poor\\nto the absolutely non poor condition. Only 2 subgroups can represent a severe limit\\nwith just one inequality factor, but they are likely to be inadequate by using many\\ninequality factors.\\nA simple but effective method to detect different degrees of poverty, overcom-\\ning the dichotomy poor and non poor, is given by the fuzzy sets. Within fuzzy sets\\nbased methods it is possible to derive and to compose both multiple unidimensional\\nand also multidimensional indicators, thus allowing a more general and ﬂexible ap-\\nproach to poverty measurement.\\nIn this work we also aim to address some issues related to the choice of the de-\\ngrees of membership to the poor of the different population subgroups: this choice\\nbelongs to the researchers and, therefore, is frequently view as arbitrary and ques-\\ntionable. The weakness implied by subjective choices refers to their inﬂuence on\\nthe stability of the results, that is, on the robustness of the method. Despite the va-\\nriety of studies on multidimensional poverty, analyses on their robustness are still\\nat a preliminary stage. Literature offers some interesting papers, among the others\\nAlkire and Santos [2] analyze the effects on robustness related to a wide variety of\\nelements, while Duclos et al. [10] develop a meaningful proposal in the framework\\nof stochastic dominance. In the following we propose a simulation study in order to\\n4 Michele Costa\\nassess the effects on the set of poor units of different degrees of membership and to\\nevaluate the robustness of the fuzzy poverty indicators.\\nOur purpose is to contribute to the theory of multidimensional poverty measure-\\nment by providing evidence in favor of fuzzy sets methods which we suggest as an\\nefﬁcient and rigorous solution. A second aim of the simulation study is to evaluate\\nthe effects of different sets of weights, ﬁrst on the ﬁnal indicator, and, most impor-\\ntantly, on the deﬁnition of the set of poor units. We implement the rank correlation\\nanalysis by referring also to the simulated indicators, thus providing an exhaustive\\ncomparison between the sets of poor units deﬁned by the different methods. Besides\\nthe methodological aspects, our results are also interesting for applied poverty anal-\\nysis and for poverty reduction policies, where the focus is the correct deﬁnition of\\nthe set of poor units.\\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 critically introduces the basic of\\nfuzzy poverty indicators, Section 3 illustrates the Monte Carlo study developed to\\nassess the properties of fuzzy indicators, Section 4 compares poor sets deﬁned by\\ntraditional, fuzzy unidimensional and fuzzy multidimensional indicators, Section 5\\npresents a case study on Italian data and Section 6 concludes.\\n2 Fuzzy poverty indicators\\nMany Authors proposed, generalized or applied fuzzy sets based methods to the\\npoverty analysis, among the others [7], [4], [8], [13]. In the variety of the meaningful\\ncontributions, we make a speciﬁc reference to the totally fuzzy approach by Cerioli\\nand Zani [6] and to the relative fuzzy approach by [7].\\nLet be Athe set of the nunitsfa1;a2;:::;ang,Bthe subset of the poor units, and\\nm(X)an indicator function, which determines the degree of membership of the i-th\\nunit to the set Bwith respect to a certain attribute X.\\nThe indicator function transforms the achievement of a unit with respect to Xto\\nthe deprivation of that unit. A low or null achievement implies a maximum depriva-\\ntion, that is m(X) =1, while a high achievement leads to an absence of deprivation,\\nthat is m(X) =0. Traditionally m(X)can assume only two values, 1 for the poor\\nunits and 0 for the non poor units, and Xis the (equivalent) income; the well known\\nhead count ratio His the most famous example of this case, obtained when the pop-\\nulation is divided in two non overlapping subgroups, poor and non poor, on the basis\\nof a poverty line zwhich uniquely deﬁnes the subset of poor units B:\\nm(X) =\\x1a\\nm1with m1=1 ifX<z\\nm2with m2=0 ifX\\x15z(1)\\nand\\nB=[\\n(aijm(X)i=1):\\nWe obtain the head count ratio Has the ratio between the number of poor and\\nthe size of the population\\nFuzzy poverty measurement: multidimensional and unidimensional indicators 5\\nH=n\\nå\\ni=1m(X)ini=n\\nå\\ni=1ni (2)\\nwhere m(X)iandniare the value of the indicator function and the sample weight of\\nthei-th unit, respectively.\\nThe presence of only two groups and the use of a poverty line zintroduce a high\\nrigidity in the analysis, since, given an eas small as desired, any unit with income\\nxi=z\\x00eis considered as a poor unit, while a unit with income xi=z+eis classi-\\nﬁed as a non poor unit. In order to overcome this limit, which also strongly affects\\npolicies and actions aimed to poverty reduction, it is necessary a more ﬂexible ap-\\nproach, such as the fuzzy method, able to allow more than two groups.\\n2.1 Fuzzy unidimensional poverty indicators\\nWithin the fuzzy sets, m(X)is no longer only equal to 0 or 1, but ranges between\\n0 and 1, thus allowing intermediate or partial membership to B: ifm(X) =1 and\\nm(X) =0 still indicate a poor and a non poor unit, respectively, values as m(X) =\\n0:8 and m(X) =0:2 refer to an almost poor and to an almost non poor unit, and\\nm(X) =0:5 to a neither poor or non poor unit.\\nThe ﬁrst problem encountered in the framework of fuzzy indicators concerns the\\nchoice of the number of groups to consider: while, in the classic case, two groups,\\npoor and non-poor, represent a forced choice, moving to k>2 groups A1;A2;:::;Ak\\nwith A=[AjandAj\\\\Ah=08i;j, the choice of kdepends on the preferences of\\nthe researchers.\\nIn order to obtain the groups, the possible outcomes of X, ranging between Xmin\\nandXmax, are divided in kintervals, one for each of the kgroups; the intervals are\\ndeﬁned by a set of (k\\x001)valuesfX1;X2;:::;Xk\\x001g, chosen by the researchers with\\nXmin<X1<X2< ::: < Xk\\x001<Xmax.\\nThe poverty attribute Xcan be a polytomous or a continuous variable (such as\\neducational level or income) or also a composite indicator speciﬁcally derived by\\nthe researchers combining different variables (such as ownership of the dwelling,\\nnumber of rooms and presence of toilet).\\nThe second issue related to fuzzy indicators refers to the necessity to associate\\nto each group a value of the indicator function, which therefore assumes kvalues\\nfm1;m2;:::;mkg.\\nIn this way the indicator function takes on a more complex form than in (1) and\\ncan be represented as\\nm(X) =8\\n>>>><\\n>>>>:m1with m1=1 ifX2[Xmin;X1]\\nm2ifX2[X1;X2]\\n:::\\nmk\\x001ifX2[Xk\\x002;Xk\\x001]\\nmkwith mk=0 ifX2[Xk\\x001;Xmax]:(3)\\n6 Michele Costa\\nA fuzzy unidimensional index evaluates the poverty condition with respect to a\\ncertain attribute Xand is obtained as in (4):\\nI(X) =n\\nå\\ni=1m(X)ini=n\\nå\\ni=1ni: (4)\\nwhere the main innovation is that m(X)can also assume intermediate values be-\\ntween 0 and 1. The head count ratio His a special case of I(X), obtained when\\nk=2 and the indicator function can be only 0 or 1.\\nThe fuzzy unidimensional index I(X), as the head count ratio, ranges between 0\\nand 1, and indicates the fraction of poor units on the total.\\nThe fuzzy approach does not possess a poverty line partitioning total population\\ninto poor and non-poor; in order to identify poor units, it is sufﬁcient to have the list\\nof the m(X)iin decreasing order and to obtain its cumulative distribution F(m(X)):\\nifF(m(X)i)<I(X)we have a poor household, while F(m(X)i)\\x15I(X)indicates a\\nnon-poor household.\\nThe subset of poor units Bis given by the union of the subgroups Ajassociated\\nto the highest values of m(X)from A1up to the subgroup Alto which belongs the\\nunit which fulﬁlls the condition F(m(X)i) =I(X):\\nB=l[\\nj=1Aj:\\nSince this unit is usually not the last of its group, also in the unidimensional fuzzy\\nframework we face a awkward situation: to the same subgroup Albelong poor units\\nup to the i-th and non poor units from the i-th.\\nA ﬁner classiﬁcation with respect to only two cases, 0 and 1, is a relevant im-\\nprovement, but the choice of the intermediate values depends on the individual re-\\nsearchers, thus introducing into the analysis a certain degree of subjectivity and,\\npotentially, of uncertainty and unstability.\\nOverall, in the analysis of fuzzy unidimensional indicators, we face two sources\\nof subjectivity, the choice of kand of the valuesfm2;:::;mk\\x001gand it is therefore\\nrelevant to assess the impact of both these elements on the ﬁnal indicator.\\n2.2 Fuzzy multidimensional poverty indicators\\nMoving from the unidimensional to the multidimensional framework requires to\\nidentify the different inequality factors and to deﬁne their number m, thus obtaining\\nthe structural economic, demographic and social factors fX1;X2;:::;Xmgrelated to\\nsome form of social exclusion and able to describe and interpret the poverty condi-\\ntion.\\nFurthermore, within a multidimensional framework, it is essential to derive a\\nweighting system which allows to rank the minequality factors.\\nFuzzy poverty measurement: multidimensional and unidimensional indicators 7\\nThe presence of minequality factors leads to introduce a second subscript j,\\nwhere m(Xj)idenotes the degree of membership to Bof the i-th unit with respect to\\nthej-th inequality factor.\\nFurthermore, minequality factors imply mindicator functions\\nm(Xj) = ( mj1;mj2;:::;mjkj)j=1;:::;m\\nwhere kjis the number of groups identiﬁed for the j-th inequality factor.\\nThe result of the matching between the nunits and the mindicator functions is a\\nmatrix M(X)with nrows and mcolumns, where the generic element represents the\\ndegree of membership to the subset of poor units for the i-th unit with respect to the\\nj-th factor.\\nBy columns of the matrix M(X), we derive the unidimensional poverty indices\\nI(X1);I(X2);:::;I(Xm)where\\nI(Xj) =n\\nå\\ni=1m(Xj)ini=n\\nå\\ni=1ni (5)\\nmeasures the poverty level, that is the fraction of poor units, with respect to the j-th\\ninequality factor.\\nBy rows of M(X), we obtain a multidimensional index for the i-th unit, I(ai),\\nwhich measures the multidimensional degree of membership to the subset of poor\\nunits for the i-th unit.\\nI(ai)is obtained as a weighted sum of the m(Xj)i\\nI(ai) =m\\nå\\nj=1m(Xj)iwj=m\\nå\\nj=1wj:\\nand ranges between 0, when the i-th unit is considered non-poor with respect to all\\nminequality factors, and 1, when the i-th unit is poor with respect to all mfactors.\\n2.2.1 The weighting structure\\nThe weights wjrepresent the distinctive feature of the multidimensional indicators\\nand measure the intensity of deprivation and social exclusion related to the j-th\\ninequality factor: the underlying guideline is that a factor not possessed by any unit\\nhas no effect on the social exclusion, while, on the contrary, if all the units but a few\\npossess the factor, it represents a relevant source of inequality and social exclusion.\\nA weighting system consistent with that is [6]\\nwCZ j=log(n=n\\nå\\ni=1m(Xj)ini) (6)\\nwhere wjis equal to 0 for m(Xj)i=1,i=1;:::;n, while wjincreases for decreasing\\nån\\ni=1m(Xj)i.\\n8 Michele Costa\\nThe case wj=0 deserves a special attention: it corresponds to the exclusion of\\nthe j-th inequality factor Xjand implies an indicator function for Xjwhich is always\\nequal to 1 for all units, that is: m(Xj)1=m(Xj)2=:::=m(Xj)n=1. When m(Xj)i=\\n18i, we assume that all units have the same value of Xjand that all perceive the\\nsame degree of poverty and social exclusion with respect to Xj. Furthermore, since\\nm(Xj)i=1, the same degree of poverty shared by all units with respect to Xjis\\nthe maximum: all are equally and most poor. If, for example, we do not consider the\\neducational level, we implicitly assume that all the units have the same qualiﬁcation,\\nand that this qualiﬁcation is also as low as possible: for the educational level it\\nmeans to consider all units as without any educational achievement, which clearly\\nrepresents a strongly unrealistic assumption.\\nThe effects of wj=0 are frequently overlooked, while they have a relevant im-\\npact, which we need to take into account.\\nA meaningful review of the issues related to the weighting structure is proposed\\nby [11], who stress both the relevance and the subtleness of this topic.\\nIn order to assess the role and the effects of the weighting structure, the pro-\\nposal outlined in (6) can be compared to other contributions, ﬁrst of all an equally\\nweighted index where we j=1=m8j.\\nA further set of weights can be derived from the budget allocation technique,\\nwhere the importance of the different factors is given by their budget share.\\nA ﬁnal proposal worth of attention is the structure wUNadopted by the Human\\nDevelopment Index [16], which assigns the same weight, 0.33, to the educational\\ndomain, the wealth domain, and the living conditions domain, and, within domains,\\nequal weight across indicators.\\nIn the following we develop the comparison of the unidimensional indicator with\\nthe multidimensional index on the basis of different weighting systems, namely we,\\nwUNandwUN.\\n2.2.2 The multidimensional poverty index for the population\\nThe synthesis of the munidimensional indices I(Xj)and of the nmultidimensional\\nindices I(ai)in a multidimensional poverty index for the population can be achieved\\nquite simply by means of a weighted sum\\nI=åm\\nj=1I(Xj)wj\\nåm\\nj=1wj=ån\\ni=1I(ai)ni\\nån\\ni=1ni=åm\\nj=1wjån\\ni=1m(Xj)ini\\nåm\\nj=1wjån\\ni=1ni(7)\\nAs in the fuzzy unidimensional case, also the multidimensional approach does\\nnot possess a poverty line and poor households are still identiﬁed on the basis of the\\ncumulative distribution of the I(ai)in descending order: if F(I(ai))<Iwe have a\\npoor household, while F(I(ai))\\x15Iindicates a non-poor household.\\nThe deﬁnition of the set of the poor units Bis a little more complicated in the\\nmultidimensional framework. First, for each poverty attribute Xjis obtained Bj, the\\nset of poor units with respect to Xj. Second, the set Bis given by the intersection\\nFuzzy poverty measurement: multidimensional and unidimensional indicators 9\\nofB1;B2;:::;Bm, or, more frequently, by the union of the intersections of different\\ncombinations of the Bj:\\nB= (\\\\Bj)[(\\\\Bh):\\nSince the multidimensional indicator Iis also a function of the weight wjit is\\nnot possible to know ex ante the exact list of Bjwhich gives B. This is not to be per-\\nceived as a limit, but, on the contrary, as an opportunity of fuzzy multidimensional\\nindicators, which take advantage of the ﬂexibility ensured by the acut method,\\nwhere we refer to a certain amount aof the population: F(I(ai) =a. By targeting\\na given fraction of the poorest unit, we obtain Ba=F(I(ai) =aand the relevant\\ninequality factors which determine Ba:Ba=UB j. The combination of factors at\\nthe basis of Bais not necessarily the same over a, but it provides powerful insights\\non the inequality structure and a strong support to any social and economic policy\\nfor poverty reduction.\\nThe issue of the subjectivity related to the choice of m1;m2;:::;mk, anticipated in\\nthe previous section for the unidimensional indicator, is ampliﬁed and more urgent\\nin the multidimensional framework, where we have mindicator functions to deter-\\nmine. In order to investigate this point, which is frequently perceived as one of the\\nweaknesses of fuzzy sets based indicators, in the following we develop a simulation\\nstudy.\\n3 Robustness of fuzzy indicators: a simulation study\\nWith the aim to assess the degree of robustness of the method and to evaluate the\\neffects of m(X)on the poverty index, we propose a simulation study where the\\nscores of the indicator function are not a priori chosen, but endogenously determined\\nby means of a Monte Carlo experiment.\\nWe randomly extract m(X)from an uniform distribution within a set of kintervals\\ndetermined according to the following scheme:\\nm(Xj) =8\\n>><\\n>>:mj1with mj12[mj2+h;1]\\n:::\\nmjk\\x001with mjk\\x0012[mjkj+h;2=kj]\\nmjkwith mjkj2[0;1=kj](8)\\nwhere kjis the exogenous number of classes proposed for Xjandhis an exogenous\\nminimum distance between two different values of m(X).\\nBy setting, e.g., k=45 and h=0:1, on the basis of (8) we obtain\\nm(Xj) =8\\n>>>><\\n>>>>:mj1with mj12[mj2+0:1;1]\\nmj2with mj22[mj3+0:1;0:80]\\nmj3with mj32[mj4+0:1;0:60]\\nmj4with mj42[mj5+0:1;0:40]\\nmj5with mj52[0;0:20](9)\\n10 Michele Costa\\nthat is we extract m15, the degree of membership to the richest subgroup, from an\\nuniform distribution within the interval [0;0:20], then we move to m14, which be-\\nlongs to the interval [m14+0:1;0:4], and so on, up to mj1, which is randomly ex-\\ntracted from an uniform distribution within the interval [m12+0:1;1].\\nThis scheme represents a perhaps excessive generalization, since the ﬁrst and\\nlast values, namely the two associated to the poorest and to the richest group, re-\\nspectively, are almost always 1 and 0, and therefore should not be included in the\\nsimulation. By setting mj1=1 and mjk=0, the simulation study refers to the re-\\nmaining k\\x002 values of the m(X)function, following a scheme such as\\nm(Xj) =8\\n>>>>>><\\n>>>>>>:mj1with mj1=1\\nmj2with mj22[mj3+h;(1\\x00h)]\\n:::\\nmjk\\x002with mjk\\x0022[mjk\\x001+h;2(1\\x00h)=(k\\x002)]\\nmjk\\x001with mjk\\x0012[h;(1\\x00h)=(k\\x002)]\\nmjkwith mjk=0(10)\\nBy referring to the new scheme (10), where mj1=1 and mjk=0, the previous\\nexample, with k=5 and h=0:1, results:\\nm(Xj) =8\\n>>>><\\n>>>>:mj1with mj1=1\\nmj2with mj22[mj3+0:1;0:9]\\nmj3with mj32[mj4+0:1;0:60]\\nmj4with mj42[mj5+0:1;0:30]\\nmj5with mj5=0\\nThe main purpose of our Monte Carlo experiment, achieved by comparing ex-\\nogenous schemes as in (3) to simulated schemes as in (10), is to investigate the\\nstability of the fuzzy poverty indices and to evaluate their robustness. By means of\\nthe same experiment we are also able to investigate other aspects of fuzzy methods.\\nFirst of all we analyze the effects related to the number of groups kjfor the each of\\ntheminequality factors, second we study the role of h, that is the distance between\\nconsecutive values of the indicator function.\\n4 Unidimensional and multidimensional comparison\\nThe key point of the comparison between the unidimensional and the multidimen-\\nsional approaches refers to the set B of poor units and, in particular, to the evaluation\\nof the intersection between the two sets.\\nThe reference to the set B of poor units is useful also in order to evaluate the ef-\\nfects of different speciﬁcations of the m(X): to the extent that different m(X)modify,\\nor not, the set B, we derive an indication on the robustness of the multidimensional\\nindicators. A similar pattern can be followed in order to assess the effects of al-\\nFuzzy poverty measurement: multidimensional and unidimensional indicators 11\\nternative weighting systems and of various compositions of the multidimensional\\nindex.\\nFrom the unidimensional approach, as well as from the multidimensional one\\nand from the simulations, we ﬁrst obtain a list of the units, from the poorest to the\\nrichest.\\nSecond, we carry out a correlation analysis on the ranks uiof the list obtained\\nfrom the unidimensional approach and on the ranks viof the list resulted from the\\nmultidimensional approach. Later, the same procedure is used for comparing the\\nlists obtained during the simulation with different m(X).\\nRank correlation analysis allows to effectively compare the two lists, and also to\\ninvestigate the similarity of speciﬁc subgroups of units, which is particularly useful\\nin our case, as we aim to the comparison between the subgroups of the poor units B\\nand also between subsets of B, that is Ba.\\nThe ﬁrst standard correlation measure used is the Bravais-Pearson correlation\\ncoefﬁcient rapplied to the ranks (ui;vi):\\nr=ån\\ni=1(ui\\x00¯u)(vi\\x00¯v)\\nån\\ni=1(ui\\x00¯u)2ån\\ni=1(vi\\x00¯v)2(11)\\nwhere ¯ uand ¯vare, respectively, the mean of uiand the mean of vi.\\nThe second correlation measure is represented by Kendall’s t, which can be ex-\\npressed as\\nt=C\\x00D\\nn(n\\x001)=2(12)\\nwhere Cis the number of concordant pairs of ranks (ui;vi)andDis the number\\nof discordant pairs of ranks (ui;vi). Kendall’s index does not consider the amount\\nof differences between uiandviand therefore can be less informative than other\\nmeasures, such as Bravais-Pearson r.\\nA further important rank correlation measure is represented by the Spearman\\nindex S:\\nS=1\\x006\\x03ån\\ni=1(ui\\x00vi)2\\nn(n2\\x001)(13)\\nFinally, the fourth correlation measure considered is the Gini rank correlation, or\\ncograduation, index G\\nG=ån\\ni=1jui\\x00v0\\nijjui\\x00vij\\nn2=2(14)\\nwhere v0\\niis the rank of the multidimensional list by ascending order, that is from the\\nrichest to the poorest.\\nAll indices range between -1 and 1, reaching their maximum (minimum) value\\nfor perfect positive (negative) correlation and assuming value 0 for the absence of\\ncorrelation between uiandvi.\\nA relevant improvement of the information provided by the correlation indices\\nrefers to the number of the units involved in the analysis. First, we start including\\nall units into the calculus of the indices, thus achieving a general evaluation related\\n12 Michele Costa\\nto the overall population. In the following step we restrict the correlation analysis\\nto a fraction aof the available units, thus focusing on speciﬁc subsamples of the\\npopulation, in primis the set Bof the poor units. Since our main interest is related\\nto the comparison between the sets of poor units suggested by different methods,\\nthis focus is extremely appealing and allows a powerful insight on the robustness of\\nfuzzy indicators.\\nFurthermore, in order to compare the two sets of poor units deﬁned by uni- and\\nmultidimensional approaches, it is also possible to derive a similarity index. Our\\ninformation set is given by the equivalent income X1, the poverty line z, the set of\\npoverty units deﬁned by X1,Bu, its size nBu, the multidimensional poverty index I,\\nthe set of poverty units deﬁned by I,Bm, and its size, nBm.\\nStarting from the unidimensional approach, a similarity index Sucan be obtained\\nas the ratio between the number of poor in the multidimensional approach with\\nincome lower than the poverty line and the number of poor in the unidimensional\\napproach:\\nsi=\\x1a\\n0 ifxi\\x15z\\n1 ifxi<zandi2Bm\\nSu=nBm\\nå\\ni=1sini=nBu\\nIt is also possible to generalize Suby referring not to the standard poverty line z,\\nbut to a set of poverty lines zawhich deﬁne the a% poorest of the observations in\\nthe unidimensional approach.\\nOn the basis of the multidimensional approach, a similarity index Smﬁrst requires\\nto introduce a poverty line z\\x03, which can be set equal to the income x\\x03of the richest\\nunit among the poor units in the multidimensional approach. Then we can obtain\\nSmas the ratio between the number of poor in the unidimensional approach with\\nincome lower than z\\x03and the number of poor in the multidimensional approach:\\nsi=\\x1a\\n0 ifxi\\x15z\\x03\\n1 ifxi<z\\x03andi2Bu\\nSm=nBu\\nå\\ni=1sini=nBm\\nAnalogously to Su, we can generalize also Smby referring to poverty lines z\\x03\\na,\\nwhich deﬁne the a% of the poorest of the observations in the multidimensional\\napproach.\\n5 Data and results\\nIn order to analyze the robustness of fuzzy sets based methods and to compare uni-\\ndimensional and multidimensional poverty indicators we resort to the Italian house-\\nFuzzy poverty measurement: multidimensional and unidimensional indicators 13\\nholds data for the 2016. We illustrate the advantages of fuzzy indicators starting\\nfrom the unidimensional case by comparing the traditional head count ratio to a\\nfuzzy indicator and to a simulated case. By adding further inequality factors we\\ndevelop a fuzzy multidimensional poverty indicator and we analyze its robustness.\\nFinally we provide a comparison between uni- and multidimensional poverty indi-\\ncators by means of a rank correlation analysis.\\n5.1 Data\\nThe Survey on Households Income and Wealth performed by the Bank of Italy\\nprovides a powerful database which allows to derive a wide set of both simple and\\ncomposite indicators based on individual and household information.\\nTo the ﬁrst set of indicators, related to the wealth domain, belong the household\\nequivalent income (I), the ratio between the number of the household members per-\\nceiving an income and the household size (II), the value and the occupancy title of\\nthe household residence (III).\\nWe also include two indicators concerning the educational domain: the educa-\\ntional achievement of the household head and his/her father (IV), and the educa-\\ntional achievement of the household spouse and her/his father (V).\\nThe further 5 indicators assess the living conditions domain. First a composite\\nindicator given by gender, age and occupational status of the household head (VI),\\nsecond the geographical area of residence (VII), third the household size and num-\\nber of bathrooms of the residence (VIII), fourth the household size and dimension\\nof the residence (IX), ﬁfth the job status of the household head and the other com-\\nponents of the household (X).\\n5.2 Simulation results\\nOur ﬁrst step in the presentation of the results refers to the effects on the fuzzy\\nindicators related to k, the number of subgroups and h, the distance between two\\nconsecutive values of m(X).\\nIn Table 1 are shown some summary descriptive statistics related to 10000 sim-\\nulations of the unidimensional fuzzy indicator I(X), as in (4), computed for each\\ncombination of kandh. The values of m(X)are obtained as in (10), and the nob-\\nservations are randomly attributed to the kclasses. We present the results for k=3,\\nk=4 and k=5 for the number of subgroups, for h=0:05,h=0:10 and h=0:20\\nfor the distance between two consecutive values of m(X)and we refer to n=7421\\nfor the number of observations, that is the number of households in the 2016 Bank\\nof Italy survey used in the following.\\n14 Michele Costa\\nTable 1 Mean m, standard deviation s, skewness g1and kurtosis g2indices for 10000 simulated\\nunidimensional fuzzy indicators I(X)byk, number of subgroups, and h, minimum distance be-\\ntween two consecutive values of m(X).\\nh k =3 k=4 k=5\\nm s g 1 g2 m s g 1 g2 m s g 1 g2\\n0.05 0.50 0.08 0.01 -1.16 0.48 0,07 -0.38 -0.50 0.47 0.05 -0.59 0.02\\n0.10 0.50 0.08 0.00 -1.19 0.48 0,05 -0.39 -0.46 0.48 0.04 -0.61 0.05\\n0.20 0.50 0.06 0.01 -1.14 0.49 0,03 -0.37 -0.42 0.49 0.01 -0.45 0.01\\nAsh, the minimum distance between two consecutive values of m(X), increases,\\na decreasing standard deviation is observed, as expected, that is a lower variability\\nof the simulated unidimensional fuzzy indices I(X).\\nThe variability of the simulated I(X)is, as intuitively, also negatively affected\\nby the number of subgroups k, which also inﬂuence the skewness g1of the I(X):\\nfork=3 we get a symmetric distribution, while for k>3 the scheme (10) leads\\nto skewed distributions, with a fat tail for smaller values, i.e. for richer units. For\\nk=3 there is an almost uniform distribution, while, as kincreases, there is both a\\ndecrease in the importance of the tails, and the presence of negative skewness.\\nIn the following, we exploit the potential of scheme (10) with the aim of carrying\\nout an in-depth analysis of the fuzzy indicators.\\n5.3 Unidimensional poverty indicator\\nThe second step of our results concerns to the unidimensional poverty indicators,\\nwhere we compare the traditional head count ratio to both a fuzzy income-based\\nindicator and simulated fuzzy indicators.\\nWe use the OECD equivalence scale and a poverty line zbeing the 60% of the\\nmedian ¯ xmeof the equivalent income: z=0:6\\x03¯xme.\\nAn income based fuzzy poverty indicator, instead to divide total population in\\nonly two subgroups, is based on k>2 subgroups: for example\\nm(X1) =8\\n>><\\n>>:1:0 ifx1i<0:4 ¯x1me\\n0:9 if 0 :4 ¯x1me\\x14x1i<0:6 ¯x1me\\n0:5 if 0 :6 ¯x1me\\x14x1i<0:8 ¯x1me\\n0 if 0 :8 ¯x1me\\x14x1i(15)\\nIn (15) we allow a greater ﬂexibility with respect to (1): under the poverty line z\\nwe assume two classes, introducing a difference among the poor, and also above the\\npoverty line we differentiate among the non poor, assigning a positive membership\\n(m13=0:5) to units with income below 0 :8 ¯x1me.\\nIn order to vary the scores of the indicator function m(X1), we run a Monte Carlo\\nexperiment, by using the scheme (10) with k=4 and h=0:1:\\nFuzzy poverty measurement: multidimensional and unidimensional indicators 15\\nm(X1) =8\\n>><\\n>>:m11with m11=1\\nm12with m122[m13+0:1;0:9]\\nm13with m132[0:1;0:45]\\nm14with m14=0(16)\\nGiven the m(X1), we derive the fuzzy unidimensional indicator I(X1)as in (4),\\nand we compare the results related to (15) and to (16), thus investigating the effects\\nofm(X)on the poverty indicator.\\nTable 1 reports in the ﬁrst column the head count ratio, equal to 0.202, in the\\nsecond the fuzzy indicator based on (15), equal to 0.264, while in the following\\ncolumns are summarized the results of 100000 random extractions of m(X1)as in\\n(16). We report, in the ﬁrst row some values of I(X1), ranging from 0.14 to 0.25,\\nand from the third to the ﬁfth row the mean of the respective simulated m(X). It is\\npossible to observe how extreme values of I(X1)occur only in correspondence with\\nunlikely values of m(X):I(X1) =0:14, for example, requires m12=0:30, which is\\nclearly an inadmissible value for incomes below the poverty line.

Table 7 shows the indices of Bravais-Pearson\\nr, Kendall t, Spearman Sand Gini GPearson; the ﬁrst column reports selected\\nvalues of the cumulative distribution of I, where Iis in decreasing order, and the\\n20 Michele Costa\\nfollowing columns show the values of the four correlation indices with respect to\\nthe three weighting systems used.

The simulated values suggest an extremely satisfactory ro-\\nbustness of the fuzzy poverty indicators, thus overcoming the objection related to\\nthe subjectivity of the choice of m(X). Furthermore, the simulation study proves to\\nbe a particularly powerful tool to investigate further characteristics of the multidi-\\nmensional fuzzy poverty indicators, such as the weighting system. The main drivers\\nof poverty, identiﬁed and ranked on 2016 Italian household data, are educational\\nachievement, dimension of the residence, job status and equivalent income, and they\\nremain remarkably stable over the simulations.\\nA key point in poverty analyses is not to establish how many are the poor house-\\nholds, but who are they. We contribute to poverty measurement by comparing the\\n22 Michele Costa\\nsets of poor units identiﬁed by traditional unidimensional, fuzzy unidimensional and\\nfuzzy multidimensional indicators.\\nThe result of rank correlation analysis allow to demonstrate that the two ap-\\nproaches deﬁne two different sets of poor households, and we also show how this\\ndifference increases as poorer population subgroups are targeted. Overall our results\\nsuggest not only two different theoretical frameworks, but also mismatched empir-\\nical ﬁndings, with the unidimensional indicator providing only partial information\\non poverty condition.\\nRelying on our conclusions, any socio-economic policy to reduce poverty devel-\\noped on the basis of income information is likely to no achieve its proposed goals,\\nbeing addressed to socioeconomic units which are, in effect, non-poor. Only in the\\nframework of the multidimensional approach it is possible to correctly individuate\\nthe set of the poor and to formulate actions able to reduce poverty.\\nAppendix\\nTable 10 Indicator function m(X1)for the I indicator: Household equivalent disposable income\\nm(X1)\\nx1i<0:4 ¯x1me 1\\n0:4 ¯x1me\\x14x1i<0:6 ¯x1me 0.9\\n0:6 ¯x1me\\x14x1i<0:8 ¯x1me 0.5\\n0:8 ¯x1me\\x14x1i 0\\nReferences\\n1.
